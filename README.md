Bow Infinity Fix
================

Removes need to have an arrow in your inventory to use the Infinity I enchant on your bow.

**Yes, this is Myrathi's mod essentially** However, I've written this version from scratch to work with Minecraft 1.7.10. I thought that doing this over complaining on Myrathi's thread about "Hai I can has InfiniBows for 1.7.10 plz? thx!" I'd just do it myself. If/when Myrathi publishes his version for 1.7.10, this will be discontinued, as it was (and is) his original idea, and I don't want to stomp on his toes *too* much. I just wanted this for 1.7.10. :P
